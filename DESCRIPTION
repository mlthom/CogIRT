Description: The CogIRT package is designed to help users psychometrically 
    analyze latent individual differences related to tasks, interventions, or 
    maturational/aging effects in the context of experimental or longitudinal 
    cognitive research. The package provides tools for parameter estimation, 
    model comparison, computerized adaptive testing, and data simulation. The 
    methods are based on approaches first described by Thomas et al. (2020)
