Description: CogIRT is an R package designed to support the application of item 
    response theory (IRT) psychometric models in cognitive science research. It 
    enables users to analyze and improve the measurement of individual 
    differences in hypothesized contrast effects, particularly in the context of
    tasks, interventions, or maturational/aging effects. The package offers 
    tools for parameter estimation, model comparisons, computerized adaptive
    testing, and data simulation. The methods are based on Thomas et al. (2020) 
    <doi:10.1177/0013164420919898>.
